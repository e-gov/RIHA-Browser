# Build process

## Prerequisites
These prerequisites are not strict but reflect an actual build environment:

 - Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
 - OpenJDK Java 1.8.0_131
 - Apache Maven 3.3.9
 - Node.js v4.2.6
 - NPM 3.5.2

## Build environment setup

### Install OpenJDK
~~~bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
~~~

### Install and configure Maven
~~~bash
sudo apt-get install maven
~~~

Project pom file contains `ria-artifactory` repository definition. This repository holds artifacts used by RIHA-Browser like RIHA-Storage-Client, for example. As this repository may not be accessible, please consider using mirror repository. Mirror repository can be configured in `~/.m2/settings.xml` file the following way
~~~xml
<settings>
  ...
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>ria-artifactory-mirror</id>
      <name>Mirror of RIA artifactory</name>
      <url>http://example.com/maven2</url>
      <mirrorOf>ria-artifactory</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
  ...
</settings>
~~~
Change at least `url` to the URL of repository you would like to use as a mirror.

### Install Node.js, NPM and additional packages
Install Node.js and make symlink since some NPM packages (like `karma-jasmine-jquery`) depend on it
~~~bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
~~~

Install NPM
~~~bash
sudo apt-get install npm
~~~

Install `libfontconfig` since PhantomJS relies on it
~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig
~~~

Install `bzip2` since some NPM packages (like PhantomJS when extracting its distro) require this
~~~bash
sudo apt-get install bzip2
~~~

Install NPM packages globally
~~~bash
sudo npm install -g karma-cli
sudo npm install -g karma
sudo npm install -g jasmine-core
sudo npm install -g karma-jasmine
sudo npm install -g karma-junit-reporter
sudo npm install -g karma-jasmine-jquery
sudo npm install -g karma-jasmine-ajax
sudo npm install -g karma-coverage
sudo npm install -g karma-phantomjs2-launcher
sudo npm install -g coffee-script@1.8.0
~~~

## Build
Project is divided into frontend and backend maven modules. Backend module depends on frontend thus requiring it to be built first.

### Frontend
Frontend is a Angular 4 module generated by Angular CLI version 1.0.4. It can be built using maven from within `frontend` directory.

**NOTE!** Following commands are executed inside `frontend` directory.

#### Install node modules and yarn
~~~bash
mvn frontend:install-node-and-yarn frontend:yarn
~~~

#### Build using maven
Build project using maven `frontend:yarn` task and calling `build` script from `package.json`. Compiled artifacts will be outputted to the `dist` directory.
~~~bash
mvn frontend:yarn@build
~~~

Build can be executed with parameters. For example, when building for production environment, following syntax can be used:
~~~bash
mvn frontend:yarn@args -Dyarn.args="run build -- -prod"
~~~
This will result in `yarn run build -- -prod` command being called which in effect will run `ng build -prod`.

### Backend
Backend is a Tomcat-based web application serving UI as well.

**NOTE!** Following commands are executed inside project root directory.

#### Build using maven
Package application as deployable Tomcat war file. Packaged application will be outputted to the `backend/target` directory with name `browser-backend-<version>.war`
~~~bash
mvn package
~~~

Please refer to deployment documentation for next steps.
